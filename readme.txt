RULES

Rules for Snake.

The main aim of this game is to make the snake reach the glowing pixel on the arena using the 4 direction switches.

At the start of the game the length of the snake should be 3 pixels and the width should be one pixel. 

The movement of the snake should be done manually i.e. depending on the direction switches pressed the snake should move only one pixel in that particular direction. (10)

Once the snake reaches a glowing pixel on the arena the length of the snake should increase by one pixel and another pixel should be made to glow immediately in a random manner. Next the snake should be made to reach that particular glowing pixel manually and so on. (50)

There are no walls or boundaries or blockades for this game. If the snake reaches the border of the arena it is supposed exit from that particular side and re-enter the arena from the opposite side. For example: if the snake reaches the top most row of a particular column of the arena ,then it has to re-enter the arena from the bottom most row of the same column. (10)

The snake dies only if it touches itself and on no other condition.(15)
As soon as the snake dies the message “GAME OVER” should be scrolled and the game should re-start automatically. (10)
